# HTML Tag Examples

This repository contains examples of various HTML tags, each explained and demonstrated in separate files. The project is designed to showcase how different HTML elements work and how they can be used in building web pages.

## Project Structure

Each HTML tag has its own file and is demonstrated with simple, practical code. The following is a list of the tags used and their corresponding files.

### Files

- **index.html**: Main page that demonstrates the use of multiple divs arranged side by side.
- **meta_example.html**: Example of `<meta>` tag usage to provide metadata for a webpage.
- **link_example.html**: Example of using the `<link>` tag to include external resources like CSS files.
- **acronym_example.html**: Demonstrates the use of the deprecated `<acronym>` tag (replaced by `<abbr>`).
- **center_example.html**: Shows how the deprecated `<center>` tag is replaced with modern CSS for centering text.
- **font_example.html**: Example of the deprecated `<font>` tag and its replacement with CSS for text styling.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/html-tag-examples.git
    ```
   
2. Open the files in your browser to see the examples:
   - Open `index.html` to see how multiple divs can be aligned side by side.
   - Explore other HTML files (like `meta_example.html`, `link_example.html`, etc.) to learn about specific HTML tags.

3. Modify or use the code as needed for your own projects.
